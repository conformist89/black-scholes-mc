# Option Pricing with Blackâ€“Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation

This project implements **European option pricing** using both the **Blackâ€“Scholes closed-form model** and a **Monte Carlo simulation** based on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.  
It also provides visualization tools to compare analytical and simulated prices, and to illustrate Monte Carlo convergence.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Blackâ€“Scholes formula** for European call and put options
- **Monte Carlo simulation** of asset paths using GBM
- Vectorized implementation for faster simulations
- Convergence plots: MC price vs number of simulations
